## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Terminal approval history SHALL expose durable state transitions
The terminal control plane SHALL retain approval requests across `pending`, `approved`, `denied`, and `expired` states, and approval queries MUST filter over durable approval history rather than a pending-only view.

#### Scenario: Query approved requests
- **WHEN** a pending approval request is approved for a terminal
- **THEN** `listApprovalRequests(statuses=["approved"])` returns that request
- **THEN** `listApprovalRequests(statuses=["pending"])` no longer returns it

#### Scenario: Query denied requests
- **WHEN** a pending approval request is denied for a terminal
- **THEN** `listApprovalRequests(statuses=["denied"])` returns that request
- **THEN** operators can inspect the historical denial without reconstructing it from leases or events

### Requirement: Terminal observation activity SHALL be explicit
Terminal inspection MUST NOT append activity history by default. Activity records for reads SHALL only be written when the caller explicitly opts into observation recording.

#### Scenario: Pure inspection does not record activity
- **WHEN** a caller reads a terminal snapshot without enabling activity recording
- **THEN** no `terminal_read` activity event is appended
- **THEN** the terminal's activity history remains unchanged

#### Scenario: Explicit observation records activity
- **WHEN** a caller reads a terminal with activity recording enabled
- **THEN** a `terminal_read` activity event is appended
- **THEN** the appended event preserves the chosen representation metadata

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Terminal inspection SHALL prefer read and snapshot primitives
The terminal control plane SHALL expose `terminal_read` and `terminal_snapshot` as the primary inspection primitives, and `terminal_read` SHALL return the most compact available representation for the requested terminal state without mutating grants or lifecycle state.

#### Scenario: Read explicitly forces snapshot
- **WHEN** a caller invokes `terminal_read` with `mode = snapshot`
- **THEN** the runtime returns the same full representation contract as `terminal_snapshot`
- **THEN** the payload still declares that the returned representation is a snapshot

#### Scenario: Snapshot returns full renderable terminal state
- **WHEN** a caller invokes `terminal_snapshot` for a running terminal with scrollback beyond the viewport
- **THEN** the payload includes the full renderable snapshot contract needed to hydrate a terminal viewport
- **THEN** the payload is not reduced to a tail-only excerpt

#### Scenario: Inspection does not auto-start a stopped terminal
- **WHEN** a caller invokes `terminal_read` or `terminal_snapshot` for a stopped terminal
- **THEN** the control plane returns a terminal-not-running style failure
- **THEN** the inspection path does not implicitly start the terminal process

#### Scenario: Inspection does not create hidden bootstrap access
- **WHEN** a caller performs a read-only inspection path
- **THEN** the control plane does not create or refresh a trusted bootstrap grant as a side effect
- **THEN** catalog access state changes only through explicit grant or lifecycle operations
