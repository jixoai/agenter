## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Runtime clients SHALL publish scoped UI updates
The runtime client SHALL expose subscription primitives that let WebUI surfaces observe narrow runtime slices so hot updates from one session do not force unrelated application surfaces to rerender.

#### Scenario: Unrelated shell surfaces stay stable during session activity
- **WHEN** a hot runtime event burst updates one session's terminal, cycle, notification, or message state
- **THEN** WebUI surfaces that do not subscribe to that session-specific slice do not receive a fresh selected value
- **THEN** unrelated shell chrome such as inactive routes or unrelated workspace lists can remain stable

#### Scenario: Unchanged selector results are not republished
- **WHEN** runtime facts update without changing the selected value for a subscriber
- **THEN** the runtime client does not republish a fresh React-facing value for that selector
- **THEN** subscribers depending on that selector can preserve render stability

#### Scenario: Active route tabs subscribe only to active heavy slices
- **WHEN** a route contains multiple heavy inspection tabs backed by different runtime slices
- **THEN** the active tab subscribes only to the slices needed for its visible panel
- **THEN** inactive tabs do not receive fresh selected values for unrelated hot slices
